# 100 Days Of Code Python
Course 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp - Dr Angela Yu

## Day 90 - Convert PDF to Audiobook

### **Reflection Time:**
This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

1. Approach:
	1. This exercise is to be done in 150 minutes.
	2. Revise the code from previous APIs projects.
	3. Copy and modified some of the code.
    1. Divide in small tasks.
	4. Make the easy tasks run first.
2. Hard part:
	1. To understant that what I was doing wrong was that I assume a wrong key as API Key, and also the limitations in PyPDF.
	2. To decide what API Text-to-Speech to use.
3. Easy part:
    1. There wasn't a easy part.
4. Improvement:
    1. Get the importance to divide in small tasks.
    2. Get the importance to revise previous and old codes.
    3. Get the importance of googling to understand what it was going on wrong on my code.
5.  Biggest Learning:
    1. To think and separete in small tasks, because after I divided, I coded in a good way.
    2. Always test the code after some change.
    3. Always check if your API key is really a API key and not a client or program key.
    4. I learnt how to use PyMuPDF in the place of PyPDF.
6.  Rectification:
    1. First of all, I'll revise previous code from other projects.
    2. I'll divide the main task in as many as possible of small tasks.
    3. Always ckeck documentation.
