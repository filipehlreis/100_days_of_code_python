### **Reflection Time:**
This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

1. Approach:
	1. This exercise is to be done in 120 minutes.
	2. Revise the code from day 66.
	3. Copy and modified some of the code.
    4. Divide in small tasks.
	5. Make the easy tasks run first.
2. Hard part:
	1. To make the SQLite works properly.
3. Easy part:
    1. Interface was the easy part for me.
    2. All the modifications was easy to do, except to use SQLite.
    3. I used Pomodoro for control my time, but I took a bit more than 2 hours to almost complete the test.
4. Improvement:
    1. Get the importance to divide in small tasks.
    2. Get the importance to revise previous and old codes.
    3. Work experience with SQLite and SQAlchemy.
5.  Biggest Learning:
    1. To think and separete in small tasks, because after I divided, I coded in a good way.
    2. Always test the code after some change.
    3. Front-end first, backend as soon as possible.
6.  Rectification:
    1. First of all, I'll revise previous code from other projects.
    2. I'll divide the main task in as many as possible of small tasks.
    3. To do one macro page each time.
    4. I also need to practice more how to work with Turtle.
