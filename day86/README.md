1. Approach:
	1. This exercise is to be done in 120 minutes.
	2. Revise the code from day 22.
	3. Copy and modified some of the code.
    4. Divide in small tasks.
	5. Make the easy tasks run first.
2. Hard part:
	1. To do te fine tune for collision ball-padlle and ball-block.
3. Easy part:
    1. Interface was the easy part for me.
    2. I used Pomodoro for control my time, but I took a bit more than 2 hours to almost complete the test.
4. Improvement:
    1. Get the importance to divide in small tasks.
    2. Get the importance to revise previous and old codes.
5.  Biggest Learning:
    1. To think and separete in small tasks, because after I divided, I coded in a good way.
    2. Always test the code after some change.
    3. Always comment your code.
6.  Rectification:
    1. First of all, I'll revise previous code from other projects.
    2. Play a bit to undestand the game.
    3. I'll divide the main task in as many as possible of small tasks.
    4. I also need to practice more how to work with Turtle.
