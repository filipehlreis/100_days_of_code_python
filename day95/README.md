This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

1. Approach:
	1. This exercise is to be done in 120 minutes.
	2. Revise codes from previous HTTP requests and API projects.
	3. Copy and modified some of the code.
    4. Divide in small tasks.
	5. Make the easy tasks run first.
2. Hard part:
	1. Modify a lot of places where changes was needed to turn 'Cafe and Wifi Website' into 'Dictionary Website'.
3. Easy part:
    1. All the rest was easy.
4. Improvement:
    1. Get the importance to divide in small tasks.
    2. Get the importance to revise previous and old codes.
5.  Biggest Learning:
    1. To think and separete in small tasks, because after I divided, I coded in a good way.
    2. Always test the code after some change.
    3. Always try to reuse old codes.
    4. Use 'try/except' to insert basic informations into structures, like a dictionary, so the program don't crash.
6.  Rectification:
    1. First of all, I'll revise previous code from other projects.
    2. I'll divide the main task in as many as possible of small tasks.
    3. Get another API to search images related to the words searched.
