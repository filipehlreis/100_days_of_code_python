Course 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp - Dr Angela Yu

## Day 84 - Image Watermarking Desktop App

### **Reflection Time:**
This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

1. Approach:
	1. This exercise is to be done in 90 minutes.
	2. Divide in small tasks.
	3. Make the easy tasks run first.
2. Hard part:
	1. To think clearly and write in a logical way.
	2. I strugle with a image without transparency that I though that had.
	3. I also strugle with Pillow.
3. Easy part:
    1. The interface GUI was easy.
4. Improvement:
    1. Get the importance to divide in small tasks.
5.  Biggest Learning:
    1. To think and separete in small tasks, because after I divided, I coded in a good way.
    2. Always test the code after some change.
6.  Rectification:
    1. First of all, I'll divide the main task in as many as possible of small tasks.
    2. I also need to practice more how to work with Pillow.
