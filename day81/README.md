Course 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp - Dr Angela Yu

## Day 81

Reflection Time:
This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

1. Approach:
	1. I revised my decode code from CodeWars, which already had a `DECODE_MORSE_CODE` dictionary and a `decodeMorse(morse_code)` function.
	2. I created the `ENCODE_MORSE_CODE` dictionary.
	3. Then I created `encodeMorse(text)` function that will encode a message to Morse.
	4. To test if it's all working together, I put a `print(decodeMorse(encodeMorse(text)))`.
2. Hard part:
	- For me, it was to revise the code from few months ago.
3. Easy part:
	- The encoding part was the easy part.
4. Improvement:
	- I need to practice more and brush my previous skills.
5. Biggest Learning:
	- I just revised my code from months ago.
6. Rectification:
	- I'd revise further.
