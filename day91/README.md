# 100 Days Of Code Python
Course 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp - Dr Angela Yu

## Day 91 - Image Colour Palette Generator

### **Reflection Time:**
This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

1. Approach:
	1. This exercise is to be done in 180 minutes.
	2. Revise the code from previous projects, like day 76.
	3. Copy and modified some of the code.
	4. Get the Cafe and Wifi website interface as a base site.
    5. Divide in small tasks.
	6. Make the easy tasks run first.
2. Hard part:
	1. How to get the predominants colors to generate the palette.
3. Easy part:
    1. The interface I used the Cafe and Wifi website as base, so it was easy to only modify the page layout.
4. Improvement:
    1. Get the importance to divide in small tasks.
    2. Get the importance to revise previous and old codes.
    3. Get the importance of googling to understand what it was going on wrong on my code.
5.  Biggest Learning:
    1. To think and separete in small tasks, because after I divided, I coded in a good way.
    2. Always test the code after some change.
    3. Had to use some code example I founded on Google and StackOverflow, using OpenCV library.
6.  Rectification:
    1. First of all, I'll revise previous code from other projects.
    2. I'll divide the main task in as many as possible of small tasks.
    3. Always ckeck documentation.
    4. Always google.
    5. Next step is to be able to use any image you want. At this moment, it's only possible to use images inside 'static' folder.
