Course 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp - Dr Angela Yu

## Day 94 - Space Invaders

### **Reflection Time:**
This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

1. Approach:
	1. This exercise is to be done in 200 minutes.
	2. Revise the code from previous Turtle projects.
	3. Copy and modified some of the code.
    4. Divide in small tasks.
	5. Make the easy tasks run first.
2. Hard part:
	1. Modify a lot of places where changes was needed to turn Pong into Space Invaders.
	2. To work with multiple shots and multiple enemy ships, and delete both after one colides with the other.
3. Easy part:
    1. All the rest was easy.
4. Improvement:
    1. Get the importance to divide in small tasks.
    2. Get the importance to revise previous and old codes.
5.  Biggest Learning:
    1. To think and separete in small tasks, because after I divided, I coded in a good way.
    2. Always test the code after some change.
    3. Always try to reuse old codes.
6.  Rectification:
    1. First of all, I'll revise previous code from other projects.
    2. I'll divide the main task in as many as possible of small tasks.
    3. Add some barriers and new types of enemy.
