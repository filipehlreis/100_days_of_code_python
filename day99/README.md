### **Reflection Time:**
This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

1. Approach:
	1. This exercise is to be done in 90 minutes.
	2. Revise codes from previous projects with Jupyter.
	3. Copy and modified some of the code.
2. Hard part:
	1. Everything was difficult for me, and this project got incomplete and not 100% right in what was done.
3. Easy part:
    1. Nothing was easy to do.
4. Improvement:
    1. Get the importance to revise previous and old codes. 
5.  Biggest Learning:
    1. Always try to reuse old codes.
    2. Experience in Data Sciense, Pandas and Jupyter.
6.  Rectification:
    1. First of all, I'll do some other course to really learn about Data Sciense. I didn't like how this topic was aborted in this course.
