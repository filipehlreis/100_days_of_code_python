# 100 Days Of Code Python
Course 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp - Dr Angela Yu

## Day 93 - Automate the Google Dinosaur Game

### **Reflection Time:**
This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

1. Approach:
	1. This exercise is to be done in 200 minutes.
	2. Revise the code from previous Pillow projects.
	3. Copy and modified some of the code.
    4. Divide in small tasks.
	5. Make the easy tasks run first.
2. Hard part:
	1. Understand WHERE and WHAT I had to begin with.
3. Easy part:
    1. After I understant that I had to take screenshots and look for specific pixels to make some action, all the rest was easy.
4. Improvement:
    1. Get the importance to divide in small tasks.
    2. Get the importance to revise previous and old codes.
5.  Biggest Learning:
    1. To think and separete in small tasks, because after I divided, I coded in a good way.
    2. Always test the code after some change.
    3. Always try new ways.
    4. The screen is dinamic, so, the best way is to save the screenshots in files to make sure what the program is 'seeing'.
    5. Always use 'try/except' in the places that its likely to cause the program to crash.
6.  Rectification:
    1. First of all, I'll revise previous code from other projects.
    2. I'll divide the main task in as many as possible of small tasks.
    3. Always google.
    4. Change some of the code to run when the dark mode is on.
