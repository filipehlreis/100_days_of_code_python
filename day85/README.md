Course 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp - Dr Angela Yu

## Day 85 - Typing Speed Test

### **Reflection Time:**
This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.
Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

1. Approach:
	1. This exercise is to be done in 120 minutes.
	2. Divide in small tasks.
	3. Make the easy tasks run first.
	4. Googling about how to get changes in Entry.
2. Hard part:
	1. How to deal with Datetime to get the time and do the calc for WPM.
	2. I used Pomodoro for control my time, but I took about 4 hours to almost complete the test.
3. Easy part:
    1. Interface was the easy part for me.
4. Improvement:
    1. Get the importance to divide in small tasks.
5.  Biggest Learning:
    1. To think and separete in small tasks, because after I divided, I coded in a good way.
    2. Always test the code after some change.
    3. Always comment your code.
6.  Rectification:
    1. First of all, I'll divide the main task in as many as possible of small tasks.
    2. I also need to practice more how to work with Datetime.
